# Theming Concepts

Drupal 8 introduced a new theming layer that helps reduce complexity for
designers and frontend developers.

Also of significance is the use of Twig as the default templating engine.
See [Twig Syntax](3.3-twig-syntax.md) and [Twig Templates](3.4-twig-templates.md) for more information about using Twig.

## Theme Configuration

All available themes can be found in the `Appearance` page.

![Change Default Theme](../../images/theme-default.png "Change Default Theme")

You can change the default frontend theme by clicking `Set as default` next to the theme
you wish to activate.

---

![Change Administration Theme](../../images/theme-admin.png "Change Administration Theme")

You can change the default admin theme by change the `Administration theme`
dropdown value and clicking the save button.

---

If a theme hasn't been installed yet, you will need to install to enable it.

![Install a Theme](../../images/theme-install.png "Install a Theme")

To do so, just click `Install` or `Install and set as default` for the theme
you wish to enable.

---

Default themes can also be set in your `system.theme.yml` configuration file.

For example:
```
admin: claro
default: olivero
```

---

Additional theme settings can be set by clicking `Settings` next to the theme
you wish to change.
