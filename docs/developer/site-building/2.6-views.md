# Views



There is a lot of functionality in views. It is one of the most important and versatile modules in Drupal. Read the [Views documentation at drupal.org updated May 2023](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/views).

This guide will just cover the bare functionality.

## Overview

The core Views module allows you to fetch content from the database of your site and present it to the user as lists, posts, galleries, tables, maps, graphs, menu items, blocks, reports, forum posts and much more. Different content types including `nodes`, `users`, and other entities can be displayed.

The `Views UI`, a submodule within Views, provides a graphical interface which can access the powerful SQL query builder to access virtually any information in your database and display it in almost any format.

Different `displays` can present the query results as pages with fixed URLs on your site (or URLs accepting arguments), blocks, feeds, or panel panes.


## Existing Views

If you enable the `Views UI` module you can see all views in your system by going to `Structure` -> `Views`.

You can edit or delete a view by clicking the respective link for the view you wish to manipulate.

By editing a view, you can see the various components of a view:

## Adding a New View

You can add a new view by going into `Structure` -> `Views` -> `Add`.

## Displays

- Each view can have multiple displays which are usually used to display the same information in slightly different ways.  Don't create too many though:

  ![Views Display](/images/views-edit-display.png)

  You can add additional displays clicking the `Add` button.

- You can also use the views display menu for more options:

  ![Views Display Menu](/images/views-edit-display-menu.png)

- A display's title can be set here:

  ![Views Display Title](/images/views-edit-display-title.png)

- Additionally, each display may have settings specific to the display type:

    - Page Display:

      ![Views Display Settings - Page Display](/images/views-edit-display-settings.png)

    - Block Display:

      ![Views Display Settings - Block Display](/images/views-edit-display-settings-block.png)

  - Feeds Display Settings:

    ![Views Display Settings - Feeds display](/images/views-edit-display-settings-feed.png)


## Format

- Depending on the format of your view, your view output can vary widely. Some include the ability to output specific fields, and others include options to output entities themselves. You will find the format here:

  ![Views Format](/images/views-edit-format.png)

  ![Views Format Feed](/images/views-edit-format2.png)

- By clicking the current format name you can change the format being used:
  ![Views Format Options](/images/views-edit-format-options.png)

- If you select a format such as `Table`, you can select from a large list of all available fields to be added to the display. (Note: You can add a field to just the particular display you are on, or all displays):
  ![Views Fields](/images/views-edit-fields-add.png)

- You can view the list of fields added to the display here:

  ![Views Fields Add](/images/views-edit-fields-list.png "Views Fields Add")


## Filtering and Sorting

- You can use certain fields and other criteria for filtering and sorting your results. Note: You can "expose" filters and sorting criteria in a view, to allow users to specify these values dynamically.

  ![Views Filter](/images/views-edit-filter.png)

  ![Views Sort](/images/views-edit-sort.png)

- By clicking the `Add` button you can choose from a large list of all available fields, filters and sorting criteria. Note: You can add a field to just the particular display you are on, or all displays.

  ![Views Filter - Add](/images/views-edit-filter-add.png)

## Headers/Footers/No Results

- You can specify specific content for the views header, footer and also define the behavior when a view returns no results:

  ![Views Header/Footer/No Results](/images/views-edit-header-footer-no-results.png)

## Pager

- You can set pagination settings for your view results.  There are options for a full pager, mini pager, or no pager at all. Also this is where you can specify the number of items per page as well as the offset. i.e. skip the first result.  (This is more useful than you might think):

  ![Views Filter - Pager](/images/views-edit-pager.png)
  - You can set the pager options:
    ![Views Filter - Pager options](/images/views-edit-pager-options.png)

## Language

- If your site is configured for [Multilingual](/developer/site-building/2.8-multilingual.md) support, you can specify language-specific settings for your results.

## Advanced

The advanced section provides functionality useful in more advanced use cases.

### Contextual Filters

From [drupal.org - Contextual filters](https://www.drupal.org/node/1578558):

Views is a highly flexible module to start with, but the contextual filters increase the use cases for the module by an order of magnitude. Contextual filters work similarly to regular filters, but there is one important difference. Instead of setting a filter value manually, the value is fetched from variables sent programmatically to the view. For example, if the view shows a list of nodes, you could have a contextual filter for the node author which would limit the list to nodes written by a specific user.  The url might be `/author-nodes/52` where 52 is the user id.

A regular filter could give you all nodes written by a specified user. A contextual filter for a node author would be able to display all nodes written by the currently viewed user, or the same user who wrote the currently viewed node. The concept is that contextual filters prepare a view for filtering, but the filter value is not yet determined. When the view is eventually called, it is also provided with data used to complete the contextual filters.

For a tutorial showing how to use contextual filters, check out [How to use Contextual filters in Drupal 8 from ostraining.com - Oct 2019](https://ostraining.com/blog/drupal/how-to-use-contextual-filters-in-drupal-8/) and [A Simple Guide on Using Contextual Filters in Drupal - Sep 2022](https://sjinnovation.com/drupal-8-views-add-filter-programmatically).

### Relationships

You can use Relationships to make connections from your view results to other entities. This is commonly done through entity reference fields. By making these connections you expose additional fields and information to views.

### Exposed Form

Advanced settings for a view's exposed filters.  This allows you to display the exposed filters in a block so you can put them in a sidebar or other region of your site.

### Other

- `Machine name` - The machine name for this specific display
- `Administrative comment` - Leave comments for admins related to this particular view or display
- `Use AJAX` - Turns on AJAX processing for filters and pagination so the view page updates without a full page reload
- `Hide attachments in summary` - Hide attachments when displaying a contextual filter summary
- `Contextual links` - Whether not to show contextual menu for this view (This is the gear icon that appears when you hover over a view).
- `Use aggregation` - Aggregate results together
- `Query settings` - Advanced database options
- `Caching` - View cache settings
- `CSS class` - Add CSS classes to your view
