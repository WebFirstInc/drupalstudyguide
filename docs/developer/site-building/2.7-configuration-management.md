# Configuration Management

Goal: Demonstrate ability to use configuration management capabilities for exporting site configurations.


## Overview

The configuration API provides a central place for modules to store configuration data. This data can be simple configuration like your site name, or more complex information managed with configuration entities, such as views and content types.

Configuration is a place to store information that you would want to synchronize from development to production. This information is often created during site-building and is not typically generated by regular users during normal site operation.

You should use the [State API](/developer/back-end/4.4-essential-apis-state.md), not configuration, for storing local variables that shouldn't travel between instances. Use state for hidden system values, and if you never want to deploy it between environments. You can reset a system, losing all state. Its configuration remains.

The configuration API comes in two flavors - the (simple) Config API and the Configuration Entity API. The key difference is that the Config API is the singleton use case. A singleton is where there can be only a single instance of this configuration. A good example would be the site's name.

The Configuration Entity API should be used to store multiple sets of configuration - for example `node types`, `views`, `vocabularies`, and `fields`.

Updating the configuration API is vital to avoid fatal errors when updating themes and modules to work in Drupal.

Configuration management in Drupal 10 works similarly to how the Features module did in Drupal 7.

By default, configuration data is stored in the `config` database table. The configuration management system built into core allows you to import and export these configuration settings across multiple environments and formats.

## Exporting Configurations

### Exporting Full Site Configurations
1. Make a configuration change to your system, such as the name of your site.
2. Navigate to `Configuration` -> `Development` -> `Configuration Synchronization` -> `Export`
3. Click `Export`
   ![Export Full Site Configuration](/images/config-export1.png)
4. Your browser will download an exported file configuration tarball (e.g. `config-ddev102-ddev-site-2024-10-17-20-04.tar.gz`)


### Exporting Single Items
1. Make a configuration change to your system, such as the name of your site.
2. Navigate to `Configuration` -> `Development` -> `Configuration Synchronization` -> `Export` -> `Single item`
3. Select the type and name of the config item you wish to export.
   ![Export Item](/images/config-export2.png)
4. You can now copy and paste this configuration elsewhere for future reference.

## Viewing Configuration Changes

1. Make a configuration change to your system for something that was previously exported, such as the name of your site.

2. Navigate to `Configuration` -> `Development` -> `Configuration Synchronization`
   ![Configuration Synchronization](/images/config-sync1.png)

3. Click `View Differences`
   ![Configuration Differences](/images/config-sync2.png)

- The `Active` column indicates the current setting in your site.
- The `Staged` column indicates the value from the previous export i.e. in the `yml` files.

## Importing Configurations

### Importing Full Site Configurations
1. Obtain a previous export tarball (See [Exporting Full Site Configuration](#exporting-full-site-configuration) above)
2. Navigate to `Configuration` -> `Development` -> `Configuration Synchronization` -> `Import`
3. Click `Import`
   ![Import Full Site Configuration](/images/config-import1.png)
4. After reviewing your changes, click `Import All`.

::: tip Note
It is almost always better to use drush to check the configuration changes before importing them.  Use `drush cst` or `drush config:status` to see what changes will be made.

### Importing Single Items
1. Obtain YAML from a previous export.
2. Navigate to `Configuration` -> `Development` -> `Configuration Synchronization` -> `Import` -> `Single item`
3. Select the type and name of the config item you wish to import and press `Import`
   ![Import Item](/images/config-import-single.png)
4. Click `Confirm`

## Drush
View configuration settings using drush:
```shell
drush config:get system.site
drush config:get system.site name
drush config:get system.site mail
# or
drush cget system.site
drush cget system.site name
drush cget system.site mail
```

Set configuration settings using drush:
```shell
drush config:set system.site name 'My Company Website'
drush config:set system.site mail 'superman@kryptonite.com'
# or
drush cset system.site name 'My Company Website'
drush cset system.site mail 'superman@kryptonite.com'
```

To export configurations using drush:
```shell
drush config:export
# or
drush cex
```

To import configurations using drush:
```shell
drush config:import
# or
drush cim
```

## Configuration Storage

You can alter the storage location of your configuration in your `settings.php` file (or comparable file in your system e.g. `settings.local.php`).:
```php
/**
 * Location of the site configuration files.
 *
 * The $settings['config_sync_directory'] specifies the location of file system
 * directory used for syncing configuration data. On install, the directory is
 * created. This is used for configuration imports.
 *
 * The default location for this directory is inside a randomly-named
 * directory in the public files path. The setting below allows you to set
 * its location.
 */
# $settings['config_sync_directory'] = '/directory/outside/webroot';
$settings['config_sync_directory'] = '../config/sync';
```
