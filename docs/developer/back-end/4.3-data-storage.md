# Data Storage

Goal: Demonstrate ability to store and retrieve data using code.

Data is stored in Drupal in either the database or in system configuration files.

- See [Configuration Management](../site-building/2.7-configuration-management.md) for interacting with the configuration.
- See [Database API](4.4-essential-apis-database.md) for interacting with the database.

## Database Support

Drupal currently supports the following database servers:

- MariaDB 10.3.7+
- MySQL/Percona 5.7.8+

See [Database server requirements](https://www.drupal.org/docs/getting-started/system-requirements/database-server-requirements)

Also [Server Requirements on drupal.org - updated Aug 2024](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/install-requirements.html#s-database) for more information.
