# Data Storage


Data is stored in Drupal 8 either in the database or in system configuration files.

- See [Configuration Management](../site-building/2.7-configuration-management.md) for interacting with the configuration.
- See [Database API](4.4-essential-apis-database.md) for interacting with the database.

## Database Support

Drupal currently supports the following database servers:
- MySQL - 8.0+ (MariaDB 10.6+, Percona 8.0+) or higher with an InnoDB-compatible primary storage engine
- PostgreSQL - 16 or higher with the pg_trgm extension
- SQLite - 3.45 or higher. Temporary local demo sites use SQLite, which is distributed as part of PHP and doesnâ€™t require installing separate database software, but make sure your version of PHP has the minimum SQLite included.
See [Drupal install requirements](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/install-requirements.html#s-database) for more information.
